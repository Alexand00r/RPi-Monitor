Multiple pages
==============

This version of RPi-Monitor introduce the notion of pages. Adding a new page can be done in configuration file by setting the parameter named <page id>.
RPi-Monitor will automatically interpret this new id and create the associated page. The new page will be accessible by a drop down menu as shown in the screenshot bellow.
